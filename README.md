## **Softwares used:**

* Blender (For creating blendshapes)
* Unity3D version 2019.4.31f1 (For the mechanics)
* Visual Studio (For scripting)
## **Task**

* The application should start with a very simple “welcome” UI panel, complete with a button
that brings the user to the main screen of the application.
* Create a login system using Scriptable Objects for 2 users. Each user can have 2 different choice of color for cloth.
* On the main screen the user can view the 3D model of a human character, and by pressing
two dedicated UI buttons, labeled “+” and “-”, the user can respectively increase or decrease
the waist of the character. Only the waist area is supposed to change in volume, when using
these buttons.
* The main screen should also include a “Play” button. When this button is clicked, a piece of
**"Cloth"** falls down on the character from above, “fitting” on the head / shoulders, with no
visible polygons of the character poking through the clothing.

## **Assets used**

* Mixamo for the 3D Model (https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&query=ninja&type=Character)
* Mixamo for the animation/poses
* Unity Assets Store for UI Buttons (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/371-simple-buttons-pack-97516)
